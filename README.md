Developed a responsive Expense Tracker application using React to help users track and manage their daily expenses. This project enhanced my skills in React, state management, and working with component-based architecture.

• This application was developed using a mobile-first approach; hence, it is flexible to different display viewports.

• This application allows users to add, edit, and delete expenses, categorize them, and view summary reports.

• Implemented User Authentication Functionality allows users to login in multiple devices

• Implemented Firebase realtime Database to save data persistently across sessions.
